# Preposal

## What idea do you have for your final project?

We plan on using screenscraping in order to analyze the sentiment of the subreddit aita. It will summarize the most common important words and be able to say the distribution of whether it is overall a negative or positive sentiment. We plan on possibly using streamlit, which lets use create a shareable web app completely through python, in order to present our data.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

## Do you have questions of your own?

Not at the moment.

#Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

AITA subreddit sentiment reader

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Program that will look at the most popular comments in a post in the AITA subreddit and read the overall sentiment on the post.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will use a screenscraping code for reddit that will allow us to choose a specific thread in the subreddit AITA. It will look through all the comments and be able to analyze the overall sentiment. It will say whether the overall sentiment is YTA, NTA, ESH or NAH. It will be able to say the total amount of comments, the title of the thread and read the sentiment. We will also have a window that will display all of this information.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A program that will be able to display a specific thread in a subreddit, the amount of comments and what the comments are.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A program that will be able to display a specific thread in the subreddit AITA, the amount of comments, and analyze the overall sentiment and display whether or not they are in the wrong.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We will have a window that will allow the user to choose a specific thread in the subreddit AITA and it will analyze the overall sentiment of the comments.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We are going to do research on the different screenscraping methods and how to do it specifiically for reddit. We will need to be able to make it display the most common comments and analyze and conclude the overall sentiment on the thread. We will look at a way to create a window for displaying our information. We will have to look at whether or not it can be created all in python or through something else.
