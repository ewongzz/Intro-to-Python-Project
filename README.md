Hi, this is our final project called Reddit AITA Analyzer by Ernest Wong and Stela Licheva.

In this project, I learned how to use HTML. We wanted a way to present the output of our python code and I found that the easiest way would 
probably be through using HTML. I experiented a lot with other methods at first such as creating a web page through python and using things like
Flask but I had difficulty with these methods. However, I learned how you can create a HTML file within python. I also learned how to format what 
you want to put in the HTML as well as do things like changing the font size, bolding, etc. I also learned how you can make the html filed be opened
when you run the python code.
However, one difficulty that I faced was making this work for everyone. In the code I have, it will only work on my computer as it is taking the
file path name and opening the html file through that. However, everyone's file path name will be different so I was unsure of how to make this
work for other people as well when running it on their computer. For everyone else, it will just create the html file on their computer but they
have to manually open it themselves. I also learned a lot about sentiment analyzers through the use of the vader module and I also was introduced
to the praw module which is used for reddit.
Overall, I really enjoyed the project and found it to be overall very sucessful. I was happy with the results we got and what I was able to learn
from this project.
