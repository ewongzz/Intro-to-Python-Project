#Hi, this is our final project called Reddit AITA Analyzer by Ernest Wong and Stela Licheva.

In this project, I learned how to use HTML. We wanted a way to present the output of our python code and I found that the easiest way would 
probably be through using HTML. I learned how you can create a HTML file within python and I also learned how to format what you want to put
in the HTML as well as do things like changing the font size, bolding, etc. I also learned how you can make the html filed be opened when 
you run the python code.
However, one difficulty that I faced was making this work for everyone. In the code I have, it will only work on my computer as it is taking the
file path name and opening the html file through that. However, everyone's file path name will be different so I was unsure of how to make this
work for other people as well when running it on their computer.
