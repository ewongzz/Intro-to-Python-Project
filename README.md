# Preposal

## What idea do you have for your final project?

We plan on using screenscraping in order to analyze the sentiment of the subreddit aita. It will summarize the most common important words and be able to say the distribution of whether it is overall a negative or positive sentiment. We plan on possibly using streamlit, which lets use create a shareable web app completely through python, in order to present our data.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

## Do you have questions of your own?

Not at the moment.
